# Client-Task---VertiSystem

Task# 1

 

Write a python3.7+ program which would run locally on the laptop and perform the following:

 

#1 Generation phase:

Program should generate N=~5000 JSON files on disk in /tmp/flights/%MM-YY%-%origin_city%-flights.json or similar folder structure where each file is a JSON array of random size M = [50 â€“ 100] of randomly generated flights data between cities. Total set of cities is K=[100-200]. Flight record is an object containing  {date, origin_city, destination_city, flight_duration_secs, # of passengers of board}. Some records, with probability L=[0.5%-0.1%] should have NULL in any of the flight record properties.

 

#2 Analysis & Cleaning phase:

Program should process those files in the most optimal way and produce the following result:

- #count of total records processed, #count of dirty records and total run duration.

- AVG and P95 (95th percentile) of flight duration for Top 25 destination cities.

- Assuming cities had originally 0 passengers, find two cities with MAX passengers arrived and left.

 

Task# 2:

Now the task is following:

Instructions:

Model Pipeline: Build a basic CI/CD pipeline High-Level Flow Diagram
Containerization: Containerize (e.g., Docker) the model and its dependencies for portability in your local

Please also define what is YAML file and why it is an essential component in automating CI/CD pipeline.
