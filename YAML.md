YAML File and Its Importance in CI/CD Pipeline
YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format. In the context of CI/CD pipelines, YAML files are commonly used to define the configuration and steps of the pipeline.

Here's why YAML files are essential in automating CI/CD pipelines:

Declarative Configuration: YAML allows you to define your pipeline configuration in a declarative manner, specifying the steps and dependencies without needing to write complex code.
Version Control Friendly: YAML files can be version-controlled along with your codebase, providing a clear history of changes to your pipeline configuration over time.
Portability: YAML files can be easily shared and reused across different projects, making it simpler to set up consistent CI/CD pipelines across your organization.
Readability: YAML's human-readable syntax makes it easy for developers and DevOps engineers to understand and modify the pipeline configuration as needed.
Overall, YAML files serve as a crucial component in automating CI/CD pipelines by providing a clear, structured way to define the pipeline configuration.
